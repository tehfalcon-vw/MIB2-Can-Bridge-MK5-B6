# MIB2-Can-Bridge-MK5-B6
# MK5 / B6 VW  MIB2 / RCD330 CAN Bridge

For Vehicles with RED MFD.

Gateway Upgrade still required for proper Infotainment Function.

Flash using Teensy Loader.

A Teensy 4.0 dual-CAN bridge for fixing the Screen Brightness, MFD Display, and Track/Station Seek on the Steering Wheel.

The bridge sits inline between the car and the radio. Most CAN traffic is forwarded transparently. The firmware only modifies or consumes the specific frames needed for the supported features.

## Features

- Fixes MIB2/RCD330 screen brightness on cars by correcting the illumination/dimming message.
- Keeps the radio responsive to the dash dimmer wheel when ambient/headlight illumination is active.
- Translates MIB2/RCD330 audio text to the Red MFD Audio page.
- Translates MIB2 navigation distance/street text to the Red MFD Navigation page.
- Optionally maps steering wheel MFD Up & Down buttons to previous/next while the Audio page is actively displayed.

## VCDS/OBD11 Coding Needed

5F Control Unit --> Adaptations --> Dimming illumination for Display Unit -->  `Y3` to `30%` and `Y4` to `100%` 
Security Access code may be needed: 20103

## Hardware Needed

Minimum recommended build:

| Qty | Part | Notes |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | CANBus Gateway | Gateway Upgrade needed for Proper 5F communication. `7N0907530BC` or Similar. |
| 1 | Teensy 4.0 | Main controller. |
| 2 | 3.3 V CAN transceiver modules | SN65HVD230 modules work well. Use boards with `TXD`, `RXD`, `VCC`, `GND`, `CANH`, and `CANL`. |
| 1 | 12 V to 5 V automotive buck converter | Use a high quality converter with stable output. |
| 1 | VW quadlock extension or breakout harness | Strongly preferred so the car loom does not need to be cut. |
| 1 | 2A Inline fuse | Put this on the adapter power feed. |
| As needed | Twisted pair wire | Use for both CANH/CANL runs. |
| As needed | Heat shrink, solder, crimp terminals, solder sleeves, strain relief | Build it like it will live in a dashboard, because it will. |

Recommended wire colors:

| Signal | Suggested color |
| --- | --- |
| CAN High | Yellow |
| CAN Low | Green |
| 12 V / 5 V positive | Red |
| Ground | Black |
| Teensy TX logic | White |
| Teensy RX logic | Blue |

Avoid:

- 5 V-only CAN transceiver boards unless they explicitly support 3.3 V logic or have a separate `VIO` pin.

## Wiring Overview

The module is an inline bridge. The car CAN wires go into one transceiver, the radio CAN wires go into the other transceiver, and the Teensy forwards traffic between them.

## Point-To-Point Wiring

### Power

| From | To |
| --- | --- |
| Vehicle switched/accessory 12 V | Buck converter input positive |
| Vehicle ground | Buck converter input negative |
| Buck converter 5 V output | Teensy `VIN` |
| Buck converter ground | Teensy `GND` |
| Teensy `GND` | Both transceiver `GND` pins |
| Teensy `3.3V` | Both transceiver `VCC` pins, if using 3.3 V transceiver modules |

Set and verify the buck converter output before connecting the Teensy. The Teensy wants 5 V on `VIN`, not raw vehicle voltage.

### Vehicle-Side Transceiver A

| Signal | Teensy 4.0 pin / label | Transceiver A pin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CAN1 TX | `CTX1`, pin `22` | `TXD` |
| CAN1 RX | `CRX1`, pin `23` | `RXD` |
| 3.3 V | `3.3V` | `VCC` |
| Ground | `GND` | `GND` |
| Vehicle CAN High | vehicle harness CAN-H | `CANH` |
| Vehicle CAN Low | vehicle harness CAN-L | `CANL` |

### Radio-Side Transceiver B

| Signal | Teensy 4.0 pin / label | Transceiver B pin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CAN2 TX | `CTX2`, pin `1` | `TXD` |
| CAN2 RX | `CRX2`, pin `0` | `RXD` |
| 3.3 V | `3.3V` | `VCC` |
| Ground | `GND` | `GND` |
| Radio CAN High | radio harness CAN-H | `CANH` |
| Radio CAN Low | radio harness CAN-L | `CANL` |

Notes:

- `TXD`/`RXD` are logic signals between the Teensy and the transceiver. They do not correlate to CAN-H/CAN-L.
- `TXD`/`RXD` do not need to be twisted pair. Keep them short and tidy.
- `CANH`/`CANL` should be twisted pair.
- If your transceiver module has an `RS`, `S`, or standby/slope pin, configure it for normal high-speed operation according to that module's documentation. On many SN65HVD230-style boards, this means tying `RS` low.

## Termination

Most cheap CAN trancievers include a 120 ohm resistor across `CANH` and `CANL`. In this inline bridge, each side connects into an existing vehicle/radio CAN segment, so extra termination is usually not wanted. MAKE SURE TO REMOVE THIS RESISTOR.

Display features:

- Audio and Navigation translation are both enabled by default.
- Navigation takes priority while route guidance is active.
- Navigation currently shows distance and street text only.

## Serial Commands

Commands are sent over USB serial at `115200` baud. Most production settings are saved to EEPROM when changed. You can also use Arduino IDE's built in Serial Monitor.
